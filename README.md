# Music Genre Classification

This repository contains code and resources for classifying music tracks into genres using machine learning. The project includes feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and a web application for genre prediction.

## Repository Structure

- `app/` - Web app backend code
- `app_streamlit.py` - Main entry point for the Streamlit web app
- `data/` - Contains raw and processed audio features and files
- `models/` - Saved machine learning models and encoders
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature extraction, and model training
- `src/` - Source code for preprocessing, feature extraction, prediction, and model training
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `WEB_APP_GUIDE.md` - Guide for running and using the web application

## Quick Overview

- Audio features are extracted (MFCCs and more) from music files
- Several machine learning models are trained and compared
- The best-performing model is used for genre prediction
- All main scripts and notebooks are organized by function

## Need Help with the Web App?

For instructions on running and using the web application, see [`WEB_APP_GUIDE.md`](WEB_APP_GUIDE.md). This guide covers installation, setup, and usage of the interactive genre classifier web app.
